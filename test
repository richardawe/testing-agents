  "summary": "# **Workflow Execution Summary: Gas Supply Proposal for Council**\n\n## **Task Overview**\n**Objective:** Develop a comprehensive, persuasive business proposal for supplying gas to a council, tailored to their specific procurement requirements and needs.\n\n## **Key Steps Completed**\n\n1. **Planning & Research (Steps 0-1):** Established clear objectives, requirements, and constraints. Identified critical information gaps (council budget, deadline, procurement guidelines, current contract details).\n2. **Research & Analysis (Step 2):** Gathered foundational information on public sector procurement standards, gas supply contract elements, and company capabilities. Documented key insights and information gaps.\n3. **Drafting & Execution (Step 3):** Created a structured business proposal template with all required sections (executive summary, scope, pricing framework, compliance, SLAs, etc.). Used placeholders for council-specific details.\n4. **Review & Validation (Step 4):** Assessed the proposal against success criteria. Identified that the proposal was a complete template but not yet finalized for submission due to missing council-specific information.\n5. **Refinement & Enhancement (Step 5):** Improved the proposal template with detailed customization guidance, an accelerated action plan, and a timeline framework to efficiently resolve information gaps.\n\n## **Main Deliverables**\n\n1. **Business Proposal Document (Enhanced Template):** A comprehensive, professionally structured proposal ready for council-specific customization. Includes detailed placeholder instructions, a customization checklist, and a timeline framework for rapid finalization.\n2. **Internal Documentation:** An enhanced proposal development log tracking decisions, information gaps, and action items with clear accountability.\n\n## **Outcomes and Results**\n\n*   **Status:** **Complete** (Template and execution plan finalized).\n*   **Achievement:** Created a robust, compliant proposal foundation that aligns with public sector procurement standards. The template is ready for immediate customization once council-specific information is obtained.\n*   **Current State:** The proposal is **not yet submission-ready**. Finalization is blocked by critical information gaps (council budget, deadline, guidelines).\n*   **Next Critical Path:** The Research Agent must execute the accelerated action plan to gather council-specific information within 24-48 hours. Once obtained, the proposal can be customized, reviewed, approved, and submitted within an estimated 5-6 days.\n\n**Conclusion:** The workflow successfully produced a high-quality proposal template and a clear, actionable plan for finalization. The next phase requires immediate information gathering to bridge the gap between the template and a submission-ready document.",
